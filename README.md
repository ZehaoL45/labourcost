# A spatial interaction model of Qin-Han Dynasty organisation on the northern frontier and the location of the Zhidao highway (China)

This repository contains all the data and scripts required to reproduce the spatial interaction modeling presented in the paper "A spatial interaction model of Qin-Han Dynasty organisation on the northern frontier and the location of the Zhidao highway (China)" authored by Zehao Li and Andrew Bevan.

## Getting Started

1.  Open the Spatial-Interaction-Model-on-Road-Network.Rproj to ensure the working directory work.
2.  Run the main.R R script in the R folder to reproduce the analysis when the number of neighbours is 15.
3.  Change the number to 10 and 13 successively. Run the main.R again to reproduce the analysis accordingly.
